# counter
This is a very simple exercise of JavaScript.

I started this project by writing some code after learning the basic of JavaScript.
Then, I added the "decrement" button with an if statement
in order to keep the number above 0 (it doesn't go below 0).


Only thing I wasn't able to implement was that when clicking the save button,
"-"(dash) only adds to middle numbers but not the last number.
Also, it would've been better if I only show the last 2 numbers and ones
before these are added up as the total number.
